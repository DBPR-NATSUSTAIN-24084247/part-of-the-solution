Code developed to analyse and plot the data for the manuscript titled
# “Part of the Solution"? Quantifying the fossil fuel industry’s renewable energy deployment

The code runs in R version 4.2.3 and RStudio version 2023.03.0+386

Input data for sections 1 to 3 has an Eikon Refinitiv private license that does not allow sharing, and hence this part of the code is not reproducible. However, the dataframe output of section 1 to 3 is given and allows to reproduce the rest of the code.

Dataframes are provided in csv format to reproduce all other sections of the code.
