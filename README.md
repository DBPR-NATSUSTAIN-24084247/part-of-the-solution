Code developed to analyse and plot the data for the manuscript titled
# “Part of the Solution"? Quantifying the fossil fuel industry’s renewable energy deployment

The code runs in R version 4.2.3 and RStudio version 2023.03.0+386

Input data for sections 3 to 5 has an Eikon Refinitiv private license that does not allow sharing, and hence this part of the code is not reproducible.

Dataframes are provided in csv format to reproduce all other sections of the code.
