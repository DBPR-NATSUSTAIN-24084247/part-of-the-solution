Code developed to analyse and plot the data for the manuscript titled
# “Part of the Solution"? Quantifying the fossil fuel industry’s renewable energy deployment

The code runs in R version 4.2.3 and RStudio version 2023.03.0+386

Input data for sections 1 to 3 has an Eikon Refinitiv private license that does not allow sharing, and hence this part of the code is not reproducible. However, the data frame output of sections 1 to 3 is given (Companies Master.csv) alongside all data frames necessary to reproduce the rest of the code.

If required, I can explore the license options of sharing a private copy of the data for sections 1 to 3.
